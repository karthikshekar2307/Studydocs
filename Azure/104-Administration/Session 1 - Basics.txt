***** Datacenter regions and region pair
- Datacenter
- regions - which is a physical location around world where we cluster data centers
- region pair

- Azure has more global regions

- Better scalability and redundancy

- preserve data residency
low larency
global foorprint
high availability

Azure region pairs
- Each azure region is always paired with another region within same geography
- Datacenters are usually 300+ miles apart
- Automatic replication and failover for some azure services
- Additional advantages of region pairs
If an extensive Azure outage occurs, one region out of every pair is prioritized to make sure at least one is restored
as quickly as possible for applications hosted in that region pair
Planned azure updates are rolled out to paired regions one region at a time to minimize downtime and risk of application outage
Data continues to reside within the same geography as its pair.


***** Availability zones
- We may have multiple availability zones in a region.
- is a set of descrete data centers


***** Resource groups
- logical grouping of resources
Subscriptions - for billing

Resources: resources are instances of services that you create like virtual machines, storage, SQL databases etc.

Resource groups: resources are combined into resource groups, which act as a logical container into which Azure resources
like web apps, databases, and storage accounts are deployed and managed.

Subscriptions groups together user accounts and the resources that have been created by those user accounts. For each subscription,
there are limits ir quotas on the amount of resourcs that you can create and use. Organizations can use subscriptions to managed
costs and the resources that are created by users, teams or projects

Management Groups: These groups help you manage access, policy, and compliance for multiple
subscriptions, All subscriptions in a management group automatically inherit the
conditions applied to the management group.


***** Azure resource manager

- Is used to deploy resources in Azure.

There are different ways to create resources in Azure using Azure resource manager
- Azure portal
- Azure Powershell
- Azure CLI
- REST clients

Resource manager template --> export template --> download --> deploy in another resource group

Storage account name should be unique in Azure.

Azure Resource manager (ARM)
- Automate resource deployments (create, update and delete) using templates
- ARM template is a JSON file that defines what you want to deploy to Azure.
- Integrate with all portals
- Easy way to deploy multiple resources
- define dependency of resources

***** Subscriptions
Attached with account, may have more than one subscriptions.
- Set budgets
- allows policies and quotas

- Using azure requires an subscription
- An azure subscription is a logical unit of azure services that
links to an azure account. It also allows you to provision resiurces
- A subscription provides you with authenticated and authorized access 
to azure products and services.
- Azure generates seperate billing reports and invoices for each
subscription
- Two types of subscription boundaries
Billing boundary
access control boundary
- You can create seperate subscriptions based on:
Environment development and testing, security or to isolate data for compliance reasons
Organizational sttuctures - IT, HR, Admin and so on
Billing: Manage and track costs based on your needs for example - production, test and dev
- Different types of subscription
Free - An email address and a credit card required to signup for a free trial
subscription that provides credit for first 30 days
Pay per use charges monthly based on cloud resource use
Enterprise: A single enterprise agreement is established for large subscription
purchases, including savings for new licenses and software assurance


***** Management groups
IF we have more subscriptions - MAnagement groups (helps manage subscriptiosn as single management 
entity to facilitate easier management)

- You can create managemant groups in a hierarchial structure with The
top level of the hierarchy at the tenant level and containing all subscriptions
in that tenant

- Any condition applied to a management group apply to all subscriptions
containeed in that management group object.

- Each mangement group and subscripton can only support one parent

- Management group can have many child
