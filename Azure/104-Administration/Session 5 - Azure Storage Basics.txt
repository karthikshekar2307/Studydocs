***** Azure Storage services overview

- Different types of data and requirements
Relational, non-relational/No-SQL, datasheets, images, videos, backups
Storage, access, security, availability, latency, processing, backups

- Different types of data service
Azure Blobs: text and binary data
Azure files: Managed file shares (SMB protocol)
Azure queues: Messaging
Azure Tables: NoSQL Store

- features
Durable and highly available - redundancy across dataacenters and regions
secure - all data encrypted by default
scalable - massively scalable
managed - azure handles hardware maintenance, updates and critical issues for you
accessible - accessible from anywhere in the world over http or https
client libraries are avaialble in all languages
support scripting in powershell or azure CLI


***** Data redundancy options
- Protect your data from hardware failures, network or power outages, and massive natural disasters
- Even in the event of a failure, redundanct ensures your storage account's availability and durability
- Trade offs between lower costs and higher availability

- Redundancy in the primary region
locally redundant storage (LRS) - three synchronous copies in same data center)
Zone-redundancy storage (ZRS) - three synchronous copies in three availabilty zones (AZs)

- Redundancy in secondary region
Geo-redundant storage (GRS) - LRS + Asynchronoys copy to secondary region()
Geo-Zone-redundant storage (GZRS)

- With GRS an GZRS, the data in the secondary region isn't available for read or write access unless there is a failover
to the secondary region.

- For read access to teh secondary region, configure your storage account to use
Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)
Read access geo-zone redundacnt storage (RA-GZRS)


***** Blob storage (binary large object)
- Blob
Any type or format
Text, images, audio, video, excel, backup files

- Use cases
Storing files for shared access
video and audio straming
storing data for analysis (data lake Gen2)
Writing to the log file
Storing data for disaster recovery, backup and archiving

- flat structure

Three types of blob storage

- Block blobs
For large objects that does not use random read and write operations files that are read from beginning to enabled
Such as media files or image files for websites

- Page blobs
Optimized for random read and write operations
Provide durable disks for Azure Virtual machines (Azure VMs)

- Append Blobs
Optimized for append operations e.g, logs
When you modify an append blob, blocks are added to the end of the blob only
Updating or deleting of existing blocks is not supported
For example, you might write all of your trace logging to the same append blob for an application running on multuple VMs


***** Storage service endpoint


***** Azure storage performance tiers
- Standards
- Premium

(a) Standard
- Backed by magnetic drives
- Support - all storage account
- Optimized for high capacity and high throughput
- provides the lowest cost per GB
- Best for applications that require bulk storage or where data is accessed infrequently
Example: Backup and DR datasets, media, pictures, videos

(b) Premium
- Backed by SSDs
- Good for vrirtaul machines and workloads that need low latency and high I/O perfornmance
- Examples: transactional databasesm big data analysis, IOT, AI or Multiple
- Block blob: Best for high transactional rated or low storage latency
- File shares: Best for enterprise or high performance applications that need to scale
- Page blobs: best for random read and write operations


***** Azure Table storage
- No SQL key-value storage
- all items are referrdd to as rows and filds known as colums
- all rows in a table must have a key
- No concept of repaltions, stored procedures, secondary indexes or foreing keys
- data will usually be denormalized
- To help ensure faset access, azure table storage splits a table into partitions
- Support very large volume of data
- Consider cosmos DB for new development
- Advantages
Its simpler to scale
a table can hold semi-structured data
No complex relationships
Data insertion and retrieval is faset
- Good to use for
Storing TBs of structired data capable of serving web scale applications
Storign datansets that dont requre complex join, foreign jeys or stored proceedures and that can be denormatlized for fast access
capturing event logging and performance monitoring data.


***** Azure Queue strorage
- Store large number of messages
- Access messages via authentuacatd calls using HTTP or https
- May contain millins of messages, up to the total capacity limit of a storage account
- Queues are commonly used to create a backlog of work to process asynchronously


***** Azure file share storage
- Enables you to create files shared in the cloud, and access these file shares from anywhere with an internet
connection
- Mounted concrrently by cloud or on-premises deployments
- Accessible from Windows, linux and macOS clients
- Accessible server message (SMB) protocol or network  file system (NFS protocol)
- Azure files ensures the data is encrypted at rest, and the SMB protocol ensures the data is encrypted in transit.
- Use cases
replace or supplement on-premises file servers
share application settings
Dev/Test/Debug
- Key benefits
Shared access: Replaces on-premises file shares with Azure file shares without application compatibility issues
Fully managed: Azure will manage hardware or an macOS
Resiliency: Yoy don't have to deal with local power and network issues


***** Disk storage
- VMs uses disks as a place to store an OS, applications and data in Azure
- One virtual machine can have one OS disk and multiple data disk but one data disk can obly be link with one VM
- Both the OS disk and the data disk are virtual hard disks (VHDs) stored in Azure storage account
- The VHDs used in Azure is .vhd files stored as page blobs in a standard or premium storage account in azure

Unmanaged disks: we can create a storage account and specify it when we create the disk
- Not recommended, previous unmanaged disks should migrate to managed disk

Managed disk
- Azure creartes and manages storage accounts in the background
- we dont have to worry abot scalability issues
- Azure created and manages the disk for us based on the size and perforance tier we specify

Managed disk types"
- Standard HDD: backup, non-critical, infrequent access
- Standard SSD: lightly used production applications or dev/test environments
- Premium SSH disks: Super fase and high performance, very low latency, recommended for production and performance sensitive workloads
- Ultra disks (SSD): for most demanding IO-intensive workloads such as SAP HANA, top tier databses (for example, SQL, Oracle, and other)
