***** Creating new subscriptions


***** Trust relation between AzureAD/Tenant and subscription
- An Azure subscription has a trust relationship with Azure Active directory
- A subscription trusts Azure AD to authenticate users, services and devices
- Multiple subscriptions can trust the same Azure AD directory, each subscription can only trust a single directory


***** Azure Tags


***** Azure resource locks
- Avoid accidental deletion of resources


***** Moving resources
- Moving resources between resource groups and subscriptions

Resource group contains the metadata of resources, where as the resources itself can be in different location.

- We can move resources to 
another resource group
another subscriptions
another region

If the resource group has read lock, we cannot move resources


***** Azure policy
enforce restrictions
enforcement of rules

we can assign policies at subscriptions and resource group policies.

- Azure policy can help you control or restrict or Audit resources
- Enforce rules on azure resources configurations to make sure they remain compliant with corporate standards
- You can apply individual policy or group of policy (initiatives)
- Two imp tasks
prevent noncompliant resources from being created
highlights existing resources that aren't compliant with the policies

Examples:
Allows only a certain SKU size for the virtual machines (VMs) to be provisioned
Mandatory tags to be created while provisioning resources
MFA should be enabled on accounts with write permissions on your subscription
Assign policy within a specific scope(management group, a single subscription or a resource group)
Policy assignments are inherited by all child resources within that scope
 You can exclude specific child resources you need to be exempt from the policy assignments


****** Management groups
- Management groups let you organize mutiple subscriptions as a single managment entity to facilitate easier management
- You can create management groups in a hierarchial structure with the top level of the hieratchy at the tenant level and containing all subscriptions in that tenant
- Any conditions applied to a management group apply to all subscriptions contained in that management group object
- Each management group and subscriptopns can support only one parent
- Each management group can have many children
- The root management group can't be moved or deleted unlike other management groups.


***** Azure cost management and Billing
This is a built-in service that gives you a breakdown of the usage and cost of your azure resources
This allows you to see what is costing you money and how it compares against your budget
You use cost management + billing features to:
- Conduct billing administrative tasks such as paying your bull
- Manage billing access to costs
- Download cost and usage data that was used to generate your monthly invoices
- Proactively apply data analysis to your costs
