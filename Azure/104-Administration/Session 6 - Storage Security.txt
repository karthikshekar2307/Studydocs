***** Configuring Storage account

***** Azure storage explorer.


***** Azure storage authorization options

- Anonymous
Public access, no authorization is required
use case: website, online documentation
only for blob

- Shared key authorization
data can be accessed using access keys

- Shared access signatures
provide limited delegated access
constraints: time interval, permissions

- Azure active directory
Role-based access control - Fine grained access can be provided to users, groups or applications.


***** Azure storage shared access key authorization
- Two default access keys are generated with every storage accoung
- Whoever has these keys can access entire storage account
- Make sure they're safe by not storing or hard coding them in your application code
store these on key vault
- If keys compromised, you can regenerate keys
- Recommendation: periodically rotate the keys
- Consider Azure AD instead


***** Azure Storage shared access signature (SAS keys)


***** Azure storage access policy
Storage access policies can be applied for SAS keys
- Will be created on container level


***** Azure AD authorization
- Azure storage can use Azure AD to authorizr requests
- Storage account level or service level (currently Blob and Queue only)
- Use role-based access control (RBAC)
user, group or service principle
- Microsoft recommended approach
benefit: no longer need to store credentials within application config files
more secure, easy to implement and manage
- Similar to IIS application pool identity approach


***** Network access control
