*****If Elif and Else statements in Python
- Control Flow: We often only want certain code to execute when a particular condition
is met.

To control this flow of logic we use some keywords
- If
- Elif
- Else

- Control flow syntax makes use of colons and indentation (Whitespace)

- This indentation system is crucial to Python and is what sets it apart from other
programming languages.

Syntax of an if statements
if some_condition:
  # execute some code
else:
  # do something else

- Syntax of an if/else statements
if some_condition:
  # execute some code
elif some_other_condition:
  # do something different
else:
  # do something else


***** For Loops in Python
Many objects in Python are "iterable", meaning we can iterate over every element in the objects

Such as every element in a list or every character in a string

we can use for loops to execute a block of code for every iteration

The term iterable means you can "iterate" over the objects

For example you can iterate over every character in a string, iterate iver every item
in a list, iterate iver every key in a dictionary

example:
my_iterable = [1,2,3]
for item_name in my_iterable:
  print(item_name)


***** While loops in Python
While loops will continue to execute a block of code while some condition remains true
For example:
While, my pool is not full, keep filling my pool with water.
Sytax:
while some_boolean_Condition:
     # do something
else 
     # do something different

3 Keywords useful with loops
Break: Breaks out of the current closest enclosing loops
continue: goes to the top of the closest enclosing loop
pass: Does nothing at all.
