**** Print Function
print("Hello world!")
- What this does is using the keyword print and what to print in paranthesis

Double quotes - tell computer between quotes are not code. They are call string


***** Double quotes
print("Day 1 - Python Print Function")
print("The function is declared like this:")
print("print('what to print')")

use single quotes to use another set of code inside a statement - we cant use double quote inside double quote


***** String manupulation and code intelligence
- Usually if we needed to run statements, we need to use it few times on the code
- we can use a method using single statement
example:
print("Hello world!\nHello world")

\n - new line

To concatenate
print("Hello" + "Karthik") - the two strings are combined but no spaces
to add a spaces
print("Hello" + " " + "Karthik")
We will notice indentation error if we insert a space before statement


***** Input function
example:
input("What is your name")

Using print function with input
print("Hello" +  " " + input("What is your name") + "!") - here input function is nested inside print function
