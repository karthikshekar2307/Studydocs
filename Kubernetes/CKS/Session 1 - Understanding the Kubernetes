Session 1 - Understanding the Kubernetes attack surface
--------------------------------------------------------

***** The attack
- Attacker tries to ping the domain name to locate the server details
- Attacker tries to do port scan to see the list of open ports
- Runs the below command to list the containers in the host
# docker -H www.vote.com ps
# docker -H www.vote.com version --> shows the version of the docker running on the host.

- Tries to run a previleged container to gain access to the host
# docker -H www.vote.com run --privileged -it ubuntu bash
- Tries to install curl
- Tries to run exploit script

- Tries to get more details on the underlying infrastructure (k8s)

Lists Iptables to check the details of ports for kubernetes dashboard
