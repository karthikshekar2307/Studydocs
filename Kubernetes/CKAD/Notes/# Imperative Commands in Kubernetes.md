 # Imperative Commands in Kubernetes

In this guide, we will explore various imperative commands used in Kubernetes to manage and interact with pods, deployments, services, and other Kubernetes resources. We will provide detailed explanations, step-by-step instructions, and code snippets to help you understand and execute these commands effectively.

## Deploying Pods

### 1. Deploying a Pod with a Specific Image:

To deploy a pod named `nginx-pod` using the `nginx:alpine` image, run the following command:

```
kubectl run --image=nginx:alpine nginx-pod
```

This command creates a pod named `nginx-pod` and runs the `nginx:alpine` image inside it.

### 2. Deploying a Pod with Labels:

To deploy a pod named `redis` using the `redis:alpine` image and set the labels to `tier=db`, use the following command:

```
kubectl run --image=redis:alpine redis --labels=tier=db
```

This command creates a pod named `redis` with the `redis:alpine` image and assigns the label `tier=db` to it.

### 3. Exposing a Pod as a Service:

To create a service named `redis-service` to expose the `redis` application within the cluster on port 6379, run the following command:

```
kubectl expose pod redis --port=6379 --name redis-service
```

This command creates a service named `redis-service` that exposes the `redis` pod on port 6379 within the cluster.

## Creating Deployments

### 4. Creating a Deployment with Replicas:

To create a deployment named `webapp` using the image `kodekloud/webapp-color` with 3 replicas, use the following command:

```
kubectl create deployment webapp --image=kodekloud/webapp-color --replicas=3
```

This command creates a deployment named `webapp` with 3 replicas, each running the `kodekloud/webapp-color` image.

### 5. Exposing a Deployment as a Service:

To expose the `webapp` deployment as a service named `webapp-service` on port 80, run the following command:

```
kubectl expose deployment webapp --port=80 --name webapp-service
```

This command creates a service named `webapp-service
