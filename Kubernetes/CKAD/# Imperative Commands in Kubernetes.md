 # Imperative Commands in Kubernetes

In this guide, we will explore how to use imperative commands in Kubernetes to perform various tasks related to managing pods, services, deployments, and other Kubernetes resources. We will provide step-by-step instructions, explain the background context and assumptions behind each command, and offer additional insights and tips to help you master imperative commands in Kubernetes.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Deploying Pods

#### 1.1. Deploy a Pod with a Specific Image

To deploy a pod named `nginx-pod` using the `nginx:alpine` image, run the following command:

```
kubectl run --image=nginx:alpine nginx-pod
```

This command creates a pod with the specified name and image. The pod will be assigned a unique ID and will start running the nginx container.

#### 1.2. Deploy a Pod with Labels

To deploy a pod named `redis` using the `redis:alpine` image and set the labels to `tier=db`, use the following command:

```
kubectl run --image=redis:alpine redis --labels=tier=db
```

This command creates a pod with the specified name, image, and labels. The labels can be used to organize and identify pods based on their roles or characteristics.

### 2. Creating Services

#### 2.1. Expose a Pod as a Service

To create a service named `redis-service` to expose the `redis` pod within the cluster on port 6379, run the following command:

```
kubectl expose pod redis --port=6379 --name redis-service
```

This command creates a service that exposes the `redis` pod on port 6379 within the cluster. This allows other pods within the cluster to access the redis service using the specified port.

### 3. Deploying Deployments

#### 3.1. Create a Deployment with Replicas

To create a deployment named `webapp` using the `kodekloud/webapp-color` image with 3 replicas, run the following command:

```
kubectl create deployment webapp --image=kodekloud/webapp-color --replicas=3
```

This command creates a deployment with the specified name, image, and number of replicas. The deployment will manage the creation and scaling of pods based on the desired replica count.
