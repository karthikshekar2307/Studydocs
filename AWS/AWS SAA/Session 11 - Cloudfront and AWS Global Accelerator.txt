any HTTP backend

CloudFront vs S32 cross region replication
- CloudFront:
Global edge network
Files are cached for a TTL (may be a day)
Great for static content that must be available everywhere

- S3 cross region replication
Must be setup for each region you want replication to happen
files are updated in near real-time
Read Only
Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low latency in few regions

***** Cloudfront - ALB or EC2 as an origin

***** Geo Restriction

***** Cache invalidations
- In case we updated the backedn orig9in, cloudfornt doesnot know about it and will only get the refreshed content after the TTL has expired
- However, you can force an entire or partial cache refresh (thus by passing the TTL) by performing a Cloudfront invalidations
- you can invalidate all files (*) or a special path (/images*)


**** AWS Global accelerator
Unicast IP vs Anycast IP

Unicast IP - One server holds one IP address

Anycast  IP: all instances have same IPs

- Works with Elastic IP, EC2 instances, ALB, NLB, public or private
- Consistent performance
Intelligent routing to lowest latency and fast regional failover
No issue with client cache (because the IP doesn't change)
Internal AWS network
- Health checks
Global accelerator performs a health check of the applocartions
helps make your application global (failover less than 1 minite for unhealthy)
Great for disaster recovery
