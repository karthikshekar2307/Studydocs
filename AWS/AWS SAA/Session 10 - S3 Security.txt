***** S3 Encryption
- Server side encryption
server side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-s3)
Server side encryptuon with KMS key stored in AWS KMS
Server side encruptuon with customer provided keys

- Client side encryption - Amazon s3client-side encryption
 
Encryption in transit
- we can force it using bucket policy

DSSE-KMS is double encryption based on KMS


***** S3 Default encryption
- SSE s3 encryption is automatically applied to new objects stored in s3 bucker
- Optionally, you can "force encryption" using a bucket policy and refuse any API call to PUT an S3 object without encryption headers (SSE-KMS or SSE-C)
Note: Bucket policies are evaluated before "Default Encryption"


**** CORS
- Cross origin resource sharing
- Origin = Scheme (protocol) + host (domain) + port
- Web browser based mechanism to allow requests to other origins while visiting the main origin
- The requests won't be fulfilled unless the other origin allows for the requests, using CORS headers


***** Amazon S3 - MFA delete
- when permanently delete
- when suspend versioning on bucket


**** S3 access logs
log access to s3 bucket


***** Pre-signed URLs
Generate pre-signed URLs using the s3 console, aws cli or SDK
URL expiration from 1 min to 720 mins (12 hours)
Users given a pre-signed URL inherit the permissions of the user that gnenrated the URL for GET/PUT


***** Glacier Vault lock and s3 object lock
- Adopt a WORM (write once read many) model
- Create a vault lock policy
- lock the policy for future eduts (can no longer be changed or deleted)
- Helpful for compliance and data retention

S3 object lock (versioning must be enabled)
- Adopt a WORM (Write once read many) model
- Block an object version deletion for a specified amount of time
- Retention mode - Compliance:
Object versions cant be overwritten or deleted by any user, including the root user
objects retention modes can't be changed, and retention periods cant be shortened
- Retention mode - Governance:
Most Users can't overwrite or delete an object version or alter its lock settings
some users have special permissions to change the retention or delete the object
- Retention period: protect the object for a fixed period, it can be extended
- Legalhold:
protect the object indefinitely, independent from retention period
can be freely placed and removed using the s3:PutObjectLegalHold IAM permission


***** S3 access points

Access point policy

S3 - access points - VPC Origin
- We can define the access point to be accessible only from within the VPC
- You must create a VPC endpoint to access the Access point (gateway or interface endpoint)
- The VPC endpoint policy must allow access to the target bucket and access point


***** S3 Object Lambda
- Use AWS Lambda functions to change the object before it is retrieved by the caller application
- Only one S3 bucket is needed, on top of which we crearte S3 access point and S3 object Lambda access points
Use cases:
Redacting personally identifyable  information for analytincs or non-production environments
Converting across data formats such as converting xml to JSON
Resizing and watermarking images on the fly using caller-specific details, such as the user who requested the object
