***** EC2 Basics

***** EC2 instances Purchasing options
- On-Demand Instances: short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second
- Reserved (1 & years)
  Reserved Instances: long workloads
  Convertible reserved instances: long workloads with flexible instances
- Savings plan (1 &3 years) : Commitment to an amount of usage, long workload
- spot instances - short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable)
- Dedicated hosts - book an entire physical server, control instance placement
- Dedicated Instances - no other customers will share your Hardware
- Capacity reservations - reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration.

(a) On-Demand:
- Pay for what you use
Linux or Windows - billing per second, after the first minute
All other operating systems - billing per hour

- Has the highest cost but no upfront payment

- No long-term Commitment

- Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, where you can't predict how the application will 
behave


(c) EC2 Reserved Instances
- Up to 72% discount compared to On-Demand
- You reserve a specific instance attributes (Instance type, region, renancy, OS)
- Reservation period - 1 year (+ discount) or 3 years (+++ discount)
- Payment Options - No Upfront (+), partial Upfront (++), all upfront (+++)
- Reserved Instances's scope - Regional or Zonal (reserve capcity in an AZ)
- Recommended for steady-state usage applications (think database)
- You can buy and sell in the reserved instance marketplace
- Convertible reserved instances
   can change the EC2 instance type, instance family, OS, scope and tenancy
   Upto 66% discount


(d) EC2 savings plan
- Get a discount based on long-term usage ( up to 72% - same as RIs)
- Commit to a certain type of usage ($10/hour for 1 or 3 years)
- Usage beyond EC2 saving plans is billed at the On-demand price
- Locked to a specific instance family and AWS region (e.g, M5 in us-east-1)
- Flexibility across:
Instance size (m5.xlarge, m5.2xlarge)
OS (linux, Windows)
Tenancy (Host, dedicated, default)


(e) Spot Instances
- Can get a discount of up to 90% compared to On-demand
- Instances that you can lose at any point of time if your max price is less than the current spot price
- The MOST cost-efficient instances in AWS
- Useful for workloads that are resilient to failure
Batch jobs
Data analysis
Image processing
Any distributed workloads
Workloads with a flexibile start and end time
- Not suitable for critical jobs or databases


(f) EC2 dedicated hosts
- A physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use
- Allows you address compliance requirements and use your existing server-bound software licenses (Per-socket,
per-core, per-VM software licenses)
- Purchasing options:
On-demand - Pay per second for active dedicated hosts
Reserved - 1 or 3 years (No Upfront, Partial upfront, All Upfront)
- The most expensive optional
- Useful for software that have complicated licensing model (BYOL - Bring your own license)
- Or for companies that have strong regulatory or compliance needs


(g) EC2 dedicated instances
- Instances run on hardware that's dedicated to you
- May share hardware with other instances in same account
- No control over instacne placement (can move hardware after stop/start)


(h) EC2 capacity reservations
- Reserve on-demand instances capacity in a specific AZ for any duration
- You always have access to EC2 capacity when you need it
- No time commitment (create/cancel anytime), no billing discounts
- Combine with regional reserved instacnes and savings plans to benefit from billing discounts
- You're charged at On-demand rate whetjer you run instacnes or Not
- Suitable for short-term, uninterrupted workloads that needs to be in a specific AZ.



***** EC2 Spot instances and spot fleet
- Discount upto 90%
- Define max spot price and get the instance while current spot price < max
The hourly spot price varies based on offer and capacity
If the current spot price > your max price you can choose to stop or terminate your instancce with a 
2 minute grace period
- Other Strategy: Spot Block
- "block" spot instance during a specified time frame (1 to 6 hours) without interruptions
- In rare situations, the instancce my be reclaimed
- Used for batch jobs, data analysis, or workloads that are resilient to failures.
- Not great for critical jobs or databases.

- How to terminate spot instances?
You can only cancel spot instance requests that are open, active or disabled.
Cancelling a spot request does not terminate instances


Spot Fleets
- Spot fleets = set of Spot instances + (optional) On-demand instances
- The spot fleet will try to meet the target capacity with price constraints
Define possible launch pools: Instancce type (m5.large), OS, Availability Zne
Can have multiple launch pools, so that the fleet can choose
Spot fleet stops launching instances when reaching capacity or max cost
- Strategies to allocate spot instances
Lowestprice: from the pool with the lowest price
diversified: distributed across all pools (great for availability , long workloads)
CacpacityOptimized: pool with the optimal capacity for the number of instances
- Spot Fleets allow us to automatically request spot instances with the lowest price
