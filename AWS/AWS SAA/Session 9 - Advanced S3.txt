***** S3 Lifecycle rules (with s3 analytics)
- Transition actions - Configure objects to transition to another storage classes
Move objects to Standard IA class 60 days after creation
Move to glacier for archiving after 6 months

- Expiration actions - configure objects expire (delete) after some time
Access log files can be set to delete after a 365 days
can be used to delete old versions of files (if versioning is enabled)
can be used to delete incomplete multipart uploads

- Rules can be created for a certain prefix

- Rules can be created for certain object tags

Storage class analysis
- help you decide when to transition objects to the right storage class
- Recommendations for standard and Standard IA 
Does not work for one-zone IA or Galcier
- Report is updated daily
- 24 to 48 hours to start seeing data analysis

***** S3 requester pays


***** S3 event notifications

***** S3 Performance
- Amazon s3 automatically scales to high request rates, latency 100-200ms
- Your application can achieve at least 3500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE or 5500 GET/HEAD rquests per second per prefix in a bucket
- There are no limits to the number of prefixes in a bucket
- If you spread reads across all for prefixes evenly, you can achieve 22000 requests per second for GET and HEAD

(a) Multi part upload
(b) S3 Transfer acceleration

(c) S3 byte-range fetches
- Parallelize GETs by requesting specific byte ranges
- Better resilience in case of failures
Can be used to retrieve only partial data (for example, head of the file)


***** S3 select and Galcier select
- Retrieve less data using SQL by prforming server-side filtering
- can filter by rows and clumns (simple SQL statements)
- Less network transfer, less CPU cost client side


***** S3 batch operations
- Perform buld operations on exisiting S3 objects with a single request.
for example
modify object metadata and properties
copy files between s3 buckets
encrypt un-encrypt objects

- A job consists a list of objectsm the action to perform and optional parameters

- S3 batch operation manages retries, tracks progress, sends completion notifications, generate reports

- You can use S3 inventory to get object list and use S3 select to filter your objects
