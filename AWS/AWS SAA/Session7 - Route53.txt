***** Route 53 Overview
- Authoritative DNS (we can update DNS)
- Also domain registrar
- Check health of resources
- 100% availability SLA

Record types
A - IP 
AAAA - IPv6 address
CNAME - Alias for another name. Can be used to redirect traffic from one website to the other, or a subdomain to an alias in another zone
NS - name servers for the hosted zone

Route 53 - Hosted Zones
- A container for records that define how to route traffic to a domain and subdomain

- Public hosted zones - contains records that specify how to route traffic on the intervention

- Private hosted zones - contain records that specify how you route traffic within one or more VPCs

***** Creating records

***** TTL (time to live)
- client will cache the data for time of TTL

***** CNAME vs Alias
CNAME: points a hostname to any other hostname (only for non-root domains)
Alias: points a hostname to any other hostname (supports root domain), native heatlh checks and its free

Alias cannot be set for EC2 DNS name


***** Routing Policy - Simple
DNS perspective

- Typically, route traffic to a single resource
- can specify multiple values in the same records
- If multiple values are returned, a random one is chosen by the client
- When alias enabled, specify only one AWS resource
- Can't be associated with health checks

Routing policy:
Simple
Weighted
Latency
failover
geolocation
IP based
multivalue


***** Routing Policy - Weighted
- Control the % of requests that go to each specific resource
- Assign each record a relative Weighted
- DNS record must have same name and type
- can be associated with heath checks
- assign weight of 0 to stop


***** Routing policy - Latency
- redirect to resource that has least latency close to used
- super helpful when latency for users is a priority
- latency is based on traffic between  users and AWS regions
- can be associated with health checks


***** Route53 Health checks
- HTTP health checks are only for public resources
- Health check: Automated DNS Failover:
1. Health checks that monitor an endpoint (application, server, other AWS resource)
2. Health checks that monitor other heatlh checks (calculated heatlh checks)
3. Health checks that monitor CloudWatch Alarms (full control) eg. Throttles of DynamoDB, alarms on RDS, custom metrics

Health checks are integrated with CW metrics

- About 15 global health checkers will check the endpoint health
health/unhealthy threshold - 3 (default)
interval - 30 sec (can set to 10 sec - higher cost)
supported protocol: HTTP, HTTPS and TCP
If > 18% of health checkers report the endpoint is healthy, Route53 considers it healthy, otherwise, its unhealthy
Ability to choose which locations you want Route 53 to use

- Health checks pass only when the endpoint responds with the 2xx and 3xx status codes
- Health checks can be setup to pass/fail based on the text in the first 5120 bytes of the response
- Configure you router/firewall to allow incoming requests from Route53 Health checkers

- Caculated ehalth checkers
Combine the results of multiple health checks into a single health check
you can use OR, AND and NOT
Can moniotor up to 256 child health checks
Specify how many of the health checks need to pass to make the parent pass
Usage: Perform maintenance to your website without causing all heatlh checks to fail

- Route53 health checkers are outside the VPCs
- They can't access provate endpoints (private VPC or on-premises resource)
- You can create a CloudWatch metric and associate a CloudWatch alarm, then create a Health check that checks the alarm itself


***** Route 53 policy - failover


***** Routing policy - geolocation
- Different from latency-based
- based on userlocation
- specify locations
- create default record
- can be associated with health checks


***** Routing policy - Geoproximity
 - based on geographic location of users
 - bias value


***** Routing policy - IP based
- based on client's IP
- you provide a list of CIDRs for your clients
- Route end users from particular ISP to specific endpoint

***** Routing policy - Multi value
- use when routing traffic to multuple resources


***** 3rd party domains and Route53
