***** Placement groups
- Sometimes you want control over the EC2 instance placement strategy
- That strategy can be defined using placement groups
- When you create a placement group, you specify one of the following strategies for the group:
(a) cluster: Cluster instacnces into a low-latency group in a single availability zone
(b) Spread: spreads instances across underlying hardware (max 7 instacnes per group per AZ) - Critical
applications
(c) partition: spreads instances across many different partitions (which rely on different sets of racks)
within an AZ. Scales to 100s of EC2 instances per group (Hadoop, Cassandra, kafka)

- Cluster: (placement group cluster low latency 10Gbps network) 
*pros: Great network (10 Gbps bandwidth between instances)
*cons: If the rack fails, all instances fail at the same time
*Use case:
Bigdata job that needs to complete fast
Application that needs extremely low latency and high network throughput

- Spread: All instances are on different hardware
*Pros:
Can span across multiple AZ
Reduce risk is simultanous failure
Ec2 instances are on different physical hardware
*Cons:
Limited to 7 instances per AZ per placement group
*Usecase
Application that needs to maximize high availability
Critical applications where each instance must be isolated from failure from each other.

- partition
Multiple partitions across AZ, each partition can have multiple EC2 instances. 
Partitions are collections of EC2 instacnes
Up to 7 partitions per AZ
Can span across multiple AZs in same region
Up to 100s of EC2 instances
The instances in a partition do not share racks with the instances in the other partitions
A partition failure can affect many EC2 but won't affect other partitions
EC2 instances get access to the partition information as metadata
* Use-cases: HDFS, HBase, Cassandra, kafka


***** ENI (Elastic Network Interfaces)
- Logical component in a VPC that represents a virtual network Card
- The ENI can have the following attributes:
Primary private IPv4, one or more secondary IPv4
One Elastic IP (IPv4) per private IPv4
One Public IPv4
One or more security groups
A MAC address
- You can create ENI independently and attach them on the fly (move them) on EC2 instances for failover
- Bound to specific AZ


***** EC2 Hibernate
- Introducting EC2 Hibernate:
The in-memory (RAM) state is preserved
The instance boot is much faster (the OS is not stopped / restarted)
Under the hood: the RAM state is written to a file in the root EBS volume
The root EBS volume must be encrypted

- Use cases:
Long-running processing
Saving the RAM state
Services that take time to initialize

* An instance can not be hibernated more than 60 days
