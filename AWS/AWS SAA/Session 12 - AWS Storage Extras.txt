***** AWS Snow Family overview
- Highly secure, protable devices to collect and process data at the edge and migrate data into and out of AWS
- Data migration:
snowcone
snowball edge
snowmobile
- Edge computing:
snowcone
snowball edge

***** Snowball into glacier
- Snowball cannot import to Glacier directly
- You must use Amazon S3 first, in combination with an S3 lifecycle policy


***** Amazon FSx
- FSx for luster
- FSx for windows file server
- FSx for NetApp ONTAP
- FSx for OpenZFS

FSx for windows file server
- FSx for windos is fully managed windows file system shared drive
- Supports SMB protocol and windows NTFS
- Microsoft Active directory integration, ACLs, user quotas
- can be mounted on Linux EC2 instances
- Supports microsoft's distributed file system (DFS) namespaces
- Scale up to 10s of GBs/sec, millions of IOPS, 100s PB of data
- Storage options:
SSD - latency sensitive workloads
HDD - broad spectrum of workloads
- can be accessed from your premises infrastrucure (VPN or Direct Connect)

FSx for Luster
- Luster is a type of parallel distributed file system, for large scale computing
- The name Lustre is derived from "Linux" and "cluster"
- Machine learning, HPC
- Video processing, Financial modeling, electronic design automation
- Scales up to 100s GB/s, millions of IOPS, sub-ms latencies
- Storage Options:
SSD: low-latency, IOPS intensive workloads, small and random file operations
HDD: Throughput intensive workloads, large and sequential file operations
- Seemless integration wth S3
Can read S3 as a filesystem (through FSx)
can write the output of the computations back to S3
- Can be used from on-premises servers (VPN or Direct connect)

Scratch filesystem
- Temporary Storage
- No replication

Persistent file system

Amazon FSx for NetApp Ontap

Amazon FSx for OpenZFS


***** Storage Gateway overview
Hybrid cloud for Storage
Bridge between on-premises data and cloud data

Use cases
- disaster recovery
- backup and restore
- tiered Storage
- on-premises cache and low-latency files access

- Types for storage gateway
S3 file gateway
FSx file gateway
Volume gateway
Tape Gateway

Volume Gateway
- Block storage using iSCSI protocol backed by s3
- backed by EBS snapshots which can help restore on-premises volumes
- cached volumes: low latency access to most recent data
- stored volumes: entire dataset is on premise, scheduled backups to S3


**** AWS Transfer Family
- A fully managed service for file transfers into and out of AWS S3 or EFS using the FTP protocol
- Supported protocols
AWS transfer for FTP
AWS transfer for FTPS
AWS transfer for SFTP
- managed infrastructure, scalable reloable andd highly available
- pay per provisioned endpoint per hour + data transfers in GB
- Store and manage users credentials within the service
- Integrate with existing authentication systems (Microsoft active directory, LDAP, Okta, Amazon Cognito, custom)
- Usage: sharing files, public datasets, CRM, ERP

***** Datasync
- Move large amout of data to and from
On-premises/other cloud to AWS
AWS to AWS
- Can synchronize to
Amazon S3
Amazon EFS
Amazon FSx
- REplication tasks can be scheduleed hourly, daily, weekly
- Transfer between AWS storage services
