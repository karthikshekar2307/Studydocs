***** Overview
- use cases
backup and storate
disaster recovery
archive
hybrid cloud storage

object values are the content of the body
- max. object size is 5TB
- IF uploading more than 5GB, must use multi-part uploading

- Metadata (list of text key/value pairs - system or user Metadata)
- Tags (unicode key/value pair - up to 10) - useful for security/lifecycle
- Version ID (if version is enabled)


**** S3 - security
- User based
IAM Policies - which APO calls should be allowed fir a specific user from IAM

- Resource based
bucket policies - bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account
object access control list (ACL) - finer grain (can be disabled)
bucket access control list (ACL) - less common (can be disabled)

Note: an IAM principal can access an S3 object if 
The user IAM permissions ALLOW it OR the resource policy ALLOWS it
And there's no explicit DENY

Encryption: encrypt objects in Amazon s3 using encryption keys


***** S3 replication
CRR and SRR
CRR - Cross region replication
SRR - same region replication

Asynchronous replocation
- enable versioning

Note:
only new objects will be replocated
existing objects can be replocated using S3 batch replication
( This replicates existing objects and objects that failed replication)

For DELETE operations
can replicate delete markers from source to target (optional setting)
Deletions with a Version ID are not replicated (to avoid malicious deletes)

There is no chaining of replication
If bucket 1 has replication into bucket 2, which has replication into bucket 3
Then the objects created in bucker 1 are not replicted to bucket 3


***** Storage classes
Standard General purpose
standard Infreqent access - for data that is less frequently accessed. but requires rapid access when needed
One Zone-Inrefquent access
glacier instant retrieval - minimum storage duration of 90 days
Glacier felxible retrieval
Galcier deep archive
intelligent tiering - move between tiers
