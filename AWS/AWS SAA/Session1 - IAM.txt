- one physical user = one AWS user
- Assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups
- Create a strong password policy
- Use and enforce the use of MFA
- Create and use roles for giving permissions to AWS services
- Use Access keys for programmatic access (CLI/SDK)
- Audit permissions of your account using IAM credentials report and IAM access advisor
- Never share IAM users and access keys
