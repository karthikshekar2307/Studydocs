***** Principles and Identities
Principles - The one who performs actions on AWS

IAM - Authentication and authorization

ways to login
- Console access
- Programmatic access

Trusted entities
IAM user
AWS services
Federated user (non-AWS)

How it works:
- Trusted entities uses an API call to assume a role, STS evaluates the request and returns temporary security credentials
- Trusted entities then, uses the temporary crdentials to access AWS resources


***** Security Policies
Policy types
- Set maximum permissions
- Grant permissions

AWS managed policies (service access, Job function)
Customer managed - Custom policy

How policies are evaluated
- Is the action explicitly denied? - yes - Deny
- Is the action explicitly denied? - No - Is the action explicitly allowed? - No - Deny (Implicit deny)
