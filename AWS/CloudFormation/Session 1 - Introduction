***** YAML Concepts
- YAML Key-value pairs
- YAML Lists
- YAML Dictionary
- YAML Lists containing dictionaries
- YAML Lists containing dictionaries containing lists
- YAML Pipe
- YAML Greater than
- YAML Comments

1. YAML Key--value pairs
- YAML documents will be full of key value pairs
- Key and value are separated by colon
- We must have a space after colon differntiating the value
- YAML supports different data types
   - Integer
   - Floating point numbers
   - Strings
   - Boolean
   - Date-Format: ISO 8601
   - Null Values
- Important note for strings: Quote strings when they have special characters like colons:, braces {}, pipes |, brackers[]

2. YAML Lists
- YAML Lists are intended with openin dash.
- Dash indicates that its a element of an array.
- All members of a list are lines beginning at the same indentation level starting with a "-" (dash and a space)
- Block sequence indicate each entry with a dash and space
- Flow sequence is written as a comma seperated list within square brackets

3. YAML Dictionaries/Map
- YAML Dictionaries are set of properties grouped together under an item.
- YAML dictionaries contain key value pairs

4. YAML list containing dictionaries

5. YAML Lists containing dictionaries containing lists

6. YAML Pipe (used as part of user-data section)
- The pipe notation, also referred to as literal block
- All new lines, indentation, extra spaces everything preserved as is

7. YAML Greater than sign
- The greater than sign notation, also referred to as folded block
- Renders the text as a single line
- All new lines will be replaced with a single space
- Blank lines are converted to new line character

8. YAML Comments
- We can have comments in YAML with # sign.
