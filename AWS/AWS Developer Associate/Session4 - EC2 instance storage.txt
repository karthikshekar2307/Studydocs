***** EBS Overview
Free Tier: 30GB of free EBS storage of type General Purpose (SSD) or magnetic per month

***** EBS Volume types
- EBS volumes come in 6 types
gp2/gp3 (SSD): general purpose SSD volume that balances price and performance for wide variety of workloads
io1/io2 (SSD): Highest-performance SSD volume for mission-critical low-latency or high-throughput workloads
st1 (HDD): Low cost HDD volume designed for frequentluy accessed, throughput-intensive workloads
sc1 (HDD): Lowest cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads
- EBS Volumes are characterized in size|Throughput|IOPS (I/O Ops per sec)
- When in doubt always consult the AWS documentation - Its good
- Only gp2/gp3 and io1/io2 can be used as boot volumes.

(a) General purpose SSD
- Cost effective storage, low-latency
- System boot volumes, virtual desktops, Development and test environments
- 1Gib - 16Tib
- gp3
Baseline of 3000 IOPS and throughput of 125 Mb/s
Can increase IOPS up to 16000 and throughput up to 1000 Mb/s independently
- gp2
Small gp2 volumes can burst IOPS to 3000
Size of the volume and IOPS are linked, max IOPS is 16000
3 IOPS per GB, means at 5333GB we are at the max IOPS

(b) Provisioned IOPS (PIOPS) SSD
- Critical business applications with sustained IOPS performance
- Or applications that need more than 16000 IOPS
- Great for database workloads (sensitive to storage perf and consistency)
- io1/io2 (4GiB - 16Tib)
Max PIOPS:64000 for Nitro EC2 instances and 32000 for other
can increase PIOPS independently from storage size
io2 have more durability and more IOPS per GiB (at the same price as io1)
- io2 block express (4Gib - 64Tib)
sub-millisecond latency
Max PIOPS:256000 with an IOPS:GiB ratio of 1000:1
- Supports EBS Multi-attach

(c) Hard disk drives (HDD)
- Cannot be a boot volume
- 125 Gib to 16Tib
- Throughput optimized HDD (st1)
Big data, data warehouses, Log processing
Max throughput 500 Mib/s - max IOPS 500
- Cold HDD (sc1):
For data that is infrequently accessed
Scenarios where lowest cost is important
Max throughput 250Mib/s - max IOPS 250


***** EBS Multi-attach
- Attach the same EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances in same AZ
- Each instance has full read and write permissions to high-performance volume
- Use-case:
Archieve higher application availability in clustered linux application (example: terradata)
applications must manage concurrent write operations
- Up to 16 EC2 instances at a time
- Must use a filesystem that's cluster-aware (Not XFS, EXT4, etc.)


***** EBS Encryption
- When you create an encrypted EBS volume, you get the following:
Data at rest is encrypted inside the volume
All the data in flight moving between the instancce and the volume us encrypted.
All snapshots are encrypted
All volumes created from snapshots
- Encryption and decryption are handled transperantly (you have nothing to do)
- Encryption has a minimal impact on latency
- EBS encryption leverages keys from KMS (AES-256)
- Copying an unencrypted snapshots allows encryption
- Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted


**** EFS
- Managed NFS (Network file system) that can be mounted on many EC2
- EFS works with EC2 instances in multi-AZ
- Highly available, scalable, expensive (3 * gp2), pay per use
- Use cases:
Content management, web serving, data sharing, wordpress
- Uses NFSv4.1 protocol
- Uses security group to control access to EFS
- Compatible with Linux based AMI (not windows)
- Encryption at rest using KMS
- POSIX file system (~Linux) that has a standard file application
- Filesystem scales automatically, pay per use, no capacity

- Storage classes
(a) EFS scale
- 1000s of concurrent NFS clients, 10GB+/s throughput
- Grow to perabyte-scale network file system, automatically

(b) Performance Mode (set at EFS creation time)
- Generalpurpose (default) - latency sensitive use cases (web server, CMS)
- Max IO - higher latency, throughput, highly parallel (big data, media processing)

(c) Throughput Mode
- Bursting - 1TB=50MiB/s + burst up to 100MB/s
- provisioned - set your throughput regardless of storage size
- Elastic - automatically scales throughput up or down based on your workloads
Up to 3Gb/s for reads and 1Gb/s for writes

Storage tiers (Lifecycle management feature - move file after N days)
- Standard: for frequently accessed filesystem
- Infrequently access (EFS-IA): cost to retrieve files, lower price to store. 
enable EFS-IA with a lifecycle policy

Availability and durability
- Standard: Multi-AZ, great for Prod.
- One Zone: One AZ, great for dev, backup enabled by default, compatible with IA (EFS one Zone-IA)

- Over 90% in cost savings
