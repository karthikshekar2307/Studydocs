AWS Regions
- AWS has regions all around the world
- Names can be us-east-1, eu-west-3....
- A region is a cluster of data centers
- Most AWS services are region-scoped


How to choose an AWS region
- Compliance: With data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission.
- Proximity to customers: reduced latency
- Available services within a region: new services and new features aren't available in every region
- Pricing: pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page.

AWS Availability zones
- Each region has many availability zones (Usually 3, min is 2 and max is 6).
- Each availability zone is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking and connectivity.
- They are seperated from each other, so that they're isolated from disasters.
- They are connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking.


AWS Points of presense (Edge locations)
- Amazon has 216 points of presense (25 edge locations and 11 regional caches) in 84 cities across 42 countries
- content is delivered to end users with low latency

AWS has global services
- IAM (Identity and access management)
- Route 53 (DNS service)
