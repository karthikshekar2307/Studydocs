Session 2 - IAM and AWS CLI
----------------------------

***** IAM Introduction
--------------------------
IAM - Identity and access management, Global service
Root Account created by default, shouldn't be used or shared
Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped
Groups only contain users, not other groups
Users dont have to belong to a group, user can belong to multiple groups


IAM: Permissions
- Users or groups can be assigned Json documents called policies
- These policies define permissions of the users
- In AWS, you apply the least previlege principle: dont give more than a user needs


***** IAM users and groups Hands On
-------------------------------------

***** IAM Policies
-------------------
Inline policy is only attached to user

- IAM Policy structure
(a) Consists of a version number
(b) id - how to identify policy
(c) Statements one or more individual statements (required)
    - Sid: an identifier for the statement
    - Effect: Whether the statement allows or denies access
    - Principle: account/user/role to which this policy applied to
    - Action: List of actions this policy allows or denies
    - Condition: Condition for when this policy is in effect (optional)

***** IAM - Password Policy
----------------------------
- Strong passwords = Higher security for your account
- In AWS, you can setup a password policy
  - Set a minimum password length
  - require specific character type
    - including uppercase letters
    - lowercase letters
    - numbers
    - non-alphanumeric characters
  - Allow all IAM users to change their own passwords
  - require users to change their password after some time (password expiration)
  - Prevent password re-use


MFA - Multi factor authentication
- Users have access to your account and can possibly change configurations or delete resources in your AWS account.
- You want to protect your Root Accounts and IAM users
- MFA = Password you know + security device you own
