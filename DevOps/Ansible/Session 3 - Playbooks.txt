***** Playbooks
- Is a text document that consists of all the configurations required to be performed in nodes.
- We write ansible playbooks in yaml.

------
Example

---
- hosts: group1 (which machines tasks will be performed)
  user: ansible (which user woul dbe performing tasks)
  become: yes   (Ansible user will perform activites as a root user)
  tasks:
     - name: install apache in nodes
       action: apt name=apache2 state=present


-name: name of the tasks
action: what need to be done
state=present: we want to install the package


# ansible-playbook firstplay.yaml  - to execute the playbook

Ansible follow idempotency: If a file or package is already install, it will not recreate the file

Adding another action

---
- hosts: group1 (which machines tasks will be performed)
  user: ansible (which user woul dbe performing tasks)
  become: yes   (Ansible user will perform activites as a root user)
  tasks:
     - name: install apache in nodes
       action: apt name=apache2 state=present
      - name: copy a file
        action: copy src=/home/ansible/file dest=/home/ansible/myfile

src - source of ansible server
