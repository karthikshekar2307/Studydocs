- Starts with pipeline and ends from pipeline (|)

pipeline {
    There are multiple stages
    like:
    - Build (any name can be given)
}

# checkout - build - test - package
# Compile - We will convert the code from user readable to machine readable
# will be compiling code from maven
# sh "mvn complile" - command will run mvn compile

# goal for testing = test

# site reports - all vulnerabilities, problems

If there is an error in stage1, the next stage will not be executed.

How to choose reports
pipelinesyntax: reports


Final step - Convert code into package

package - single executable file.


pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('checkout'){
           steps{
            git url: "https://github.com/akshu20791/DevOpsClassCodes/"
           }

        }
         stage('kar-compile'){
            steps{
              echo " we are compiling the code"
              sh "mvn compile"
            }
         }
         stage('kar-test'){
            steps{
              echo " we are testing the code"
              sh "mvn test"
            }
         }
         stage('kar-QA'){
            steps{
              echo " we are checking the quality of the code"
              sh "mvn pmd:pmd"
              recordIssues(tools: [pmdParser()])
            }
         }
         stage('kar-package'){
            steps{
              echo " we are convert code to package"
              sh "mvn package"
            }
         }

    }
}


****** Automate the build whenever there is an update in GitHub 

SourceCode polling: after certain duration make Jenkins to look for new updates
